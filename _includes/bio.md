Hi there! 

I am a researcher in the MLR team at Bayer, where I work on uncertainty quantification.

Before joining Bayer, I did a short postdoc at Aalto University with Vikas Garg and Markus Heinonen. And before that, I was lucky to do my PhD on a topic I still love the most: differential geometry in machine learning (mostly variational autoencoders), supervised by Søren Hauberg and Georgios Arvanitidis. You can read my thesis [here](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/differential-geometric-approaches-to-machine-learning/).

Even though I am now in industry, I stay very much connected to the academic world, with ongoing collaborations and workshops (GRaM [2024](https://gram-workshop.github.io/2024/), [2026](https://gram-workshop.github.io/index.html)).
