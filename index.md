Hi there!

My name is Alison Pouplin, and I am a PhD student at the Technical University of Denmark ([DTU](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/research-sections/cogsys)) in the Department of Applied mathematics and Computer science, under the supervision of [SÃ¸ren Hauberg](http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~sohau/) and [David Eklund](https://people.kth.se/~daek/).

My research consists in exploring the [Finslerian aspects of random geometry](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/phd/current-phd/phd-cogsys/alison-marie-sandrine-pouplin), and applying some ideas to improve machine learning models. Finslerian geometry is an extension of Riemannian geometry, with a broader definition of the metric that might help us to study manifolds from a statistical point of view.

Prior to my current position, I spent two years developing machine learning algorithms to detect skin cancer. I previously studied bioengineering, applied physics and photonics at the [Imperial College](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) (London, UK), [ESPCI](https://www.espci.psl.eu/en/) (Paris, France) and [Institut d'Optique](https://www.institutoptique.fr/en) (Saclay, France).

May this PhD diary sparks you joy. Feel free to reach out!
